			<p style="font-style: italic; padding: 3% 10% 3% 10%; font-size: 18px;">So far, my research has been developed following three key directions related to neutrino physics. The first one is the determination of <a href= "#mandm"><em>neutrino masses and mixings</em> from the joint analysis of data from different neutrino oscillation experiments, beta decay measurements, neutrinoless double beta decay searches and cosmological observations. The second line of research consists of the study of <a href="#properties"> <em>other neutrino properties</em></a> including non-standard interactions with matter or electromagnetic properties such as magnetic moments. The third pillar of the research conducted was the search for <a href= "#dm"> <em>connections between neutrinos and dark matter</em></a>, either arising from a direct coupling between both species or the use of neutrino experiments as dark matter detectors.</p>

				<p>Flavour oscillations provide conclusive evidence that neutrinos have non-degenerate masses, two of them (at least) different from zero. This is, together with dark matter, the only experimental evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Over the years, the quantum phenomenon of neutrino oscillations has been tested in different experimental setups, with neutrinos and antineutrinos from different sources. In recent years, global fits to neutrino data have allowed the determination of the mixing parameters and the squared mass differences with unprecedented accuracy.</p>

				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11237" target = "_blank"><h3>2020 Global reassessment of the neutrino oscillation picture</h3></a>
				<p>In <a "https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11237" target = "_blank">	<spam style="font-style: italic;">JHEP 2021, 71 (2021)</spam></a>, we present the status of the three-neutrino oscillation picture after combining all the available data up to 2020. Whereas four of the oscillation parameters are determined with great accuracy (&Delta;m<sup>2</sup><sub>21</sub>, |&Delta;m<sup>2</sup><sub>31</sub>|, &theta;<sub>12</sub> and &theta;<sub>13</sub>) three open questions remain unanswered. First, which is the octant of the atmospheric mixing angle, &theta;<sub>23</sub>, (which could also be maximal, i.e &theta;<sub>23</sub> = &pi;/2 )? Second, is there CP violation in the neutrino sector? Finally, is the mass ordering normal? (i.e. is the lightest neutrino state with the largest fraction of electron neutrino flavour state?).</p>

					<p>In many extensions of the Standard Model, additional neutrino properties beyond masses and mixing arise. For instance, non-standard interactions (NSI) between neutrinos and other charged fermions. In addition, massive neutrinos are expected to have tiny, yet non-zero, electromagnetic moments. The existence of additional degrees of freedom could give rise to larger, and thus testable, electromagnetic moments.

					<h3>Non-standard interactions between neutrinos and the first generation of quarks</h3>
					<p> Neutral current NSI between neutrinos and d-type quarks (or u-type quarks) can be constrained using oscillation data. In particular, in the future, the complementarity of the medium baseline reactor experiment JUNO and the measurement of solar neutrinos at Hyper-Kamiokande will allow constraining non-standard interactions to be around 10% the strength of Standard Model ones. The key point is that this would be possible while having a subpercent determination of the oscillation parameters mainly involved in the solar sector, &Delta;m<sup>2</sup><sub>21</sub> and &theta;<sub>12</sub>, as shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03031" target = "_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">PRD 105 (2022) 3, 035004</span></a>.</p>

					<h3>Non-standard neutrino-electron interactions</h3>
					<p>Neutral current NSI between neutrinos and electrons can also be tested in oscillation experiments, as well as from the study of scattering measurements and some observables at e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> colliders. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08168"><span style="font-style: italic">PLB 820 (2021) 136508</span></a>, we explored how these NSI would alter the picture of neutrino decoupling. We also pointed out the potential of future cosmological surveys to constrain them from the determination of the effective number of relativistic species, N<sub>eff</sub>.</p>

					<h3>Neutrino magnetic moments and spin flavour precession</h3>
					<p>If neutrinos are Majorana, the interaction of their magnetic moments with the magnetic field in the Sun would give rise to the phenomenon of spin-flavour precession. In that case, a small, yet potentially detectable, flux of electron antineutrinos is expected. Analytical calculations in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04516"> 2207.04516</a> can be used to derive limits on this scenario and are easy to implement in future searches.</p>

				<p>Among the large variety of dark matter candidates, two particular ones can be probed in neutrino experiments. Interestingly, they happen to lie on opposite extremes of the mass spectrum.</p>

					<h3>Neutrinos from primordial black hole evaporation</h3>
					<p> Neutrinos can be emitted as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs). For a certain PBH mass range, the emitted neutrinos would have energies around MeV or smaller and could be detected in existing neutrino experiments. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05013" target = "_blank"><span style="font-style: italic"> JCAP 10 (2021) 051</span></a>, the sensitivity of DUNE and the proposed experiment THEIA are studied.</p>

					<h3>Neutrino interactions with ultralight scalars</h3>
					<p> Ultralight dark matter (scalars with masses around 10<sup>-20</sup>eV)  could provide a better agreement between small-scale cosmological simulations and observations. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08431" target = "_blank"> <span style="font-style: italic">PRD 106 (2022) 3, 033004</span></a>, we present a cosmology-friendly scenario of neutrino-ultralight dark matter that leads to a testable signature in beta decay experiments. Besides that,  oscillation experiments like DUNE can test this type of interaction (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03590" target = "_blank"><span style ="font-style: italic; font-size: 16px">JHEP 01 (2021) 094</span></a> ).</p>
